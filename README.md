# flowers_classifier
 Build and train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 


- image_classifier_project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook contains the first part of the project which is developing an Image Classifier with TensorFlow.
- predict.py: Python script that runs from the command line and uses the trained network model (flowers_classifier.h5) to predict the class for a flower input image.
- flowers_classifier.h5: The trained network model, a result of (image_classifier_project.ipynb) file.
- label_map.json: A dictionary mapping the integer coded labels to the actual names of the flowers.
